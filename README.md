# FormFlow 🇮🇳

AI-powered scholarship navigator for Indian college students.

## What it does
FormFlow helps first-generation college students from Tier-2/3 cities navigate India's government scholarship system — auto-detecting eligibility, filling forms, catching errors before submission, and tracking application status.

## Problem
Over ₹8,000 crore in scholarships go unclaimed annually. Not because students are ineligible — but because the system is too complex to navigate without guidance.
